POTENTIAL TASKS (Proto-issues)

- de-embed text when the combinators aren't really capturing any knowledge
	- is the knowledge reusable?
	- is the knowledge derivable from existing knowledge?
	- if the answers to these questions are unclear, make it text (for now)

- literature survey
	- model driven development
	- grounded theory
	- knowledge modelling
	- existing scientific knowledge ontologies

- review existing "manual" examples looking for errors/inconsistencies

- apply inspection and review techniques to improve existing "manual" examples

- create a rigorous model for the types of knowledge captured in the SRS:
	- what distinguishes a data definition from a theoretical model?
	- what is the required relationships between the parts?
	
- support Dan's work by, for instance:
	- creating figures
	- proof reading
	- doing anything Dan can assign as an issue

- documentation of using Drasil, Drasil design, steps to create a new document

- improve design documentation for existing case studies
	- document design like an SRS through refinement

- add additional test cases to the existing examples

- redo the game physics documentation and implementation to no longer use Chipmunk

- add doxygen (or similar) comments to "manual" code, or better yet, generate documentation comments

- move to using pandoc

- move to using MathJax

- issue #475 Setting up Drasil documentation/test infrastructure, (https://github.com/JacquesCarette/Drasil/issues/475)
