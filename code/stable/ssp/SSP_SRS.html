<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
A slope of geological mass, composed of soil and rock, is subject to the influence of gravity on the mass. For an unstable slope this can cause instability in the form of soil/rock movement. The effects of soil/rock movement can range from inconvenient to seriously hazardous, resulting in signifcant life and economic loses. Slope stability is of interest both when analyzing natural slopes, and when designing an excavated slope. Slope stability analysis is the assessment of the safety of a slope, identifying the surface most likely to experience slip and an index of it's relative stability known as the factor of safety.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a slope stability analysis problem. The developed program will be referred to as the Slope Stability Analysis (SSA) program. This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the system, the organization of the document and the characteristics of the intended readers.
</p>
<a id="Sec:PoD">
<div class="subsection">
<h3>
Purpose of Document
</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
The SSA program determines the critical slip surface, and it's respective factor of safety as a method of assessing the stability of a slope design. The program is intended to be used as an educational tool for introducing slope stability issues, and will facilitate the analysis and design of a safe slope.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out, the most logical way to present the documentation is still to fake a rational design process.
</p>
</div>
</a>
<a id="Sec:SoR">
<div class="subsection">
<h3>
Scope of Requirements
</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
The scope of the requirements is limited to stability analysis of a 2 dimensional slope, composed of homogeneous soil layers. Given appropriate inputs, the code for SSA will identify the most likely failure surface within the possible input range, and find the factor of safety for the slope as well as displacement of soil that will occur on the slope.
</p>
</div>
</a>
<a id="Sec:OoD">
<div class="subsection">
<h3>
Organization of Document
</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by Koothoor as well as Smith and Lai. The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the instance models in <a href=#Sec:IM>this Section</a> and trace back to find any additional information they require.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
The goal statements are refined to the theoretical models, and the theoretical models to the instance models. The instance models provide the set of algebraic equations that must be solved iteratively to perform a Morgenstern Price Analysis.

<h3>
Problem Description
</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
SSA is a computer program developed to evaluate the factor of safety of a slope's slip surface and to calculate the displacement that the slope will experience.
</p>
<a id="Sec:T">
<div class="subsubsection">
<h4>
Terminology
</h4>
<div class="list">
<p>
Factor of Safety: Stability metric. How likely a slip surface is to experience failure through slipping.
</p>
<p>
Critical Slip Surface: Slip surface of the slope that has the lowest global factor of safety, and therefore most likely to experience failure.
</p>
<p>
Stress: Forces that are exerted between planes internal to a larger body subject to external loading.
</p>
<p>
Strain: Stress forces that result in deformation of the body/plane.
</p>
<p>
Normal Force: A force applied perpendicular to the plane of the material.
</p>
<p>
Shear Force: A force applied parallel to the plane of the material.
</p>
<p>
Tension: A stress that causes displacement of the body away from its center.
</p>
<p>
Compression: A stress that causes displacement of the body towards its center.
</p>
<p>
Plane Strain: The resultant stresses in one of the directions of a 3 dimensional material can be approximated as 0. Results when the length of one dimension of the body dominates the others. Stresses in the dominate dimensions direction are the ones that can be approximated as 0.

Physical System Description
</h4>
<p class="paragraph">
Analysis of the slope is performed by looking at properties of the slope as a series of slice elements. Some properties are interslice properties, and some are slice or slice base properties.

Interslice properties convention is noted by j. The end interslice properties are usually not of interest, therefore use the interslice properties from 1 &le; i &le; n-1.

<h4>
Assumptions
</h4>
<p class="paragraph">
This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the theoretical model by filling in the missing information for the physical system. The numbers given in the square brackets refer to the data definition, or the instance model, in which the respective assumption is used.
</p>
<div class="list">
<p>
A1: The slip surface is concave with respect to the slope surface. The (x,y) coordinates of the failure surface follow a monotonic function.
</p>
<p>
A2: The geometry of the slope, and the material properties of the soil layers are given as inputs.
</p>
<p>
A3: The different layers of the soil are homogeneous, with consistent soil properties throughout, and independent of dry or saturated conditions, with the exception of unit weight.
</p>
<p>
A4: Soil layers are treated as if they have isotropic properties.
</p>
<p>
A5: Interslice normal and shear forces have a linear relationship, proportional to a constant (&lambda;) and an interslice force function (f<sub>i</sub>) depending on x position.
</p>
<p>
A6: Slice to base normal and shear forces have a linear relationship, dependent on the factor of safety (FS), and the Coulomb sliding law.
</p>
<p>
A7: The stress-strain curve for interslice relationships is linear with a constant slope.
</p>
<p>
A8: The slope and slip surface extends far into and out of the geometry (z coordinate). This implies plane strain conditions, making 2D analysis appropriate.
</p>
<p>
A9: The effective normal stress is large enough that the resistive shear to effective normal stress relationship can be approximated as a linear relationship.
</p>
<p>
A10: The surface and base of a slice between interslice nodes are approximated as straight lines.

<h4>
Instance Models
</h4>
<p class="paragraph">
This section transforms the problem defined in <a href=#Sec:PD>this Section</a> into one which is expressed in mathematical terms. It used concrete symbols defined in <a href=#Sec:DD>this Section</a> to replace the abstract symbols in the models identified in <a href=#Sec:TM>this Section</a> and <a href=#Sec:GD>this Section</a>.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
The Morgenstern Price method is a vertical slice, limit equilibrium slope stability analysis method. Analysis is performed by breaking the assumed failure surface into a series of vertical slices of mass. Static equilibrium analysis using two force equilibrium, and one moment equation as in T2. The problem is statically indeterminate with only these 3 equations and one constitutive equation (the Mohr Coulomb shear strength of T3) so the assumption of GD5 is used. Solving for force equilibrium allows definitions of all forces in terms of the physical properties of DD1 to DD9, as done in DD10, DD11.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
The values of the interslice normal force E the interslice normal/shear force magnitude ratio lambda, and the Factor of Safety (FS), are unknown. Equations for the unknowns are written in terms of only the values in DD1 to DD9, the values of R<sub>i</sub>, and T<sub>i</sub> in DD10 and DD11, and each other. The relationships between the unknowns are non linear, and therefore explicit equations cannot be derived and an iterative solutions method is required.

<h4>
Data Constraints
</h4>
<p class="paragraph">
<a href=#Table:>this Table</a> and <a href=#Table:>this Table</a> show the data constraints on the input and output variables, respectively. The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations on the range of values that can be taken by the variable. The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the flexibility to experiment with unusual situations. The column of typical values is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario. The uncertainty column provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be measured. This information would be part of the input if one were performing an uncertainty quantification exercise.
