<h1>Specific System Description</h1>
<p class="paragraph">
This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level view of the problem to be solved. This is followed by the solution characteristics specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, and definitions that are used.

<h2>Solution Characteristics Specification</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
The instance models that govern Projectile are presented in <a href=#Sec:IMs>Section: Instance Models</a>. The information to understand the meaning of the instance models and their derivation is also presented, so that the instance models can be verified.
</p>
<div id="Sec:Assumps">
<div class="subsubsection">
<h3>Assumptions</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the theoretical model by filling in the missing information for the physical system. The numbers given in the square brackets refer to the Theoretical Models <a href=#Sec:TMs>Section: Theoretical Models</a>, General Definitions <a href=#Sec:GDs>Section: General Definitions</a>, Data Definitions <a href=#Sec:DDs>Section: Data Definitions</a>, Instance Models <a href=#Sec:IMs>Section: Instance Models</a>, Likely Changes <a href=#Sec:LCs>Section: Likely Changes</a>, or Unlikely Changes <a href=#Sec:UCs>Section: Unlikely Changes</a>, in which the respective assumption is used.
