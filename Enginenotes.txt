Chipmunk:


/Src:
CMakeLists.txt
-Installation, version, and files
chipmunk.c
-error handling. initialize chipmunk. defines functions for moment and area
-of circles, segments, polys and boxes. these take in num of verticies, length,
-width, height, or radius of shapes etc.
cpArbiter.c
-may be calculating attributes of a collision when detected. gets point,
-depth, normal and impulse. also functions for applying impulse and updating
-arbiter
cpArray.c
-functions for basic array manipulation? c doesn't already have these? push,pop,
-delete,free,new
cpBB.c
-ball bearing or some kind of beam. funtions for clamp and wrap vector calculation
cpBBTree.c
-tree manipulation functions. pair/thread functions. other functions
-to create tree nodes and node sets, insert, recycle, query, and remove subtrees
-similar functions with leaves. memory allocation functions. tree insertion,
-removal, and query.
cpBody.c
-many functions defining characteristics of a "body" and body manipulation. body
-creation, mass, moment and shape functions. also constraints? filter and remove.
-related to node. may be some sort of restriction on movement. body set angle,
-position. update functions for position and velocity. apply functions for 
-force and impulse. another Arbiter function. wish I knew what arbiter was.
cpCollision.c: Need to investigate more.
-circle2circlequery is circle on circle collision detection?
-circle2circle, circle2segment, circle2poly, poly2poly and seg2poly.
-unsure what is being calculated. tangential and
-normal distance? but then what is the dif from this and query? functions for
-min separating axis for a poly. findverts and find verts fallback calculate contacts
-for penetrating/overlapping vertexes. segvalueonAxis? function to find vertexes
-penetrating a segment. collideshapes function.
