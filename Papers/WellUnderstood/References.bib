@book{Dalkir2011,
	abstract = {The ability to manage knowledge has become increasingly important in today's knowledge
economy. Knowledge is considered a valuable commodity, embedded in products and in
the tacit knowledge of highly mobile individual employees. Knowledge management (KM)
represents a deliberate and systematic approach to cultivating and sharing an organization's
knowledge base. It is a highly multidisciplinary field that encompasses both information
technology and intellectual capital. This textbook and professional reference offers
a comprehensive overview of the field of KM, providing both a substantive theoretical
grounding and a pragmatic approach to applying key concepts. Drawing on ideas, tools,
and techniques from such disciplines as sociology, cognitive science, organizational
behavior, and information science, the text describes KM theory and practice at the
individual, community, and organizational levels. It offers illuminating case studies
and vignettes from companies including IBM, Xerox, British Telecommunications, JP
Morgan Chase, and Nokia. This second edition has been updated and revised throughout.
New material has been added on the information and library science perspectives, taxonomies
and knowledge classification, the media richness of the knowledge-sharing channel,
e-learning, social networking in KM contexts, strategy tools, results-based outcome
assessments, knowledge continuity and organizational learning models, KM job descriptions,
copyleft and Creative Commons, and other topics. New case studies and vignettes have
been added; and the references and glossary have been updated and expanded. },

@inproceedings{Farmer2007,
	abstract = {An axiomatic theory represents mathematical knowledge declaratively as a set of axioms. An algorithmic theory represents mathematical knowledge procedurally as a set of algorithms. A biform theory is simultaneously an axiomatic theory and an algorithmic theory. It represents mathematical knowledge both declaratively and procedurally. Since the algorithms of algorithmic theories manipulate the syntax of expressions, biform theories---as well as algorithmic theories---are difficult to formalize in a traditional logic without the means to reason about syntax. Chiron is a derivative of von-Neumann-Bernays-G{\"o}del (nbg) set theory that is intended to be a practical, general-purpose logic for mechanizing mathematics. It includes elements of type theory, a scheme for handling undefinedness, and a facility for reasoning about the syntax of expressions. It is an exceptionally well-suited logic for formalizing biform theories. This paper defines the notion of a biform theory, gives an overview of Chiron, and illustrates how biform theories can be formalized in Chiron.},
