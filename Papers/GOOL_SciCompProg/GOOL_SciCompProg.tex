\section{Introduction}

- extol the virtues of a “generate all things” approach
- introduce Drasil
- requirements for Drasil to be effective
	- multiple back-ends, since research software developers want code in
        their chosen language, has to fit into an ecosystem of existing code
	- a design language that will allow for variabilities between the
        generated code and documentation
	- generative back-end needs to be extensible to new languages with
        minimal effort
- the above requirements motivate the design and implementation of GOOL

\section{Background}

- more on Drasil

\section{Design of GOOL}

- borrow from Brooks’ MASc thesis document

\section{Implementation of GOOL}

- borrow from Brooks’ MASc thesis document
- maybe this would be where we would mention the OO Patterns in GOOL (Chapter 6
of Brooks’ thesis)?

\section{Design Language}

- some motivating examples

\section{Literature Review}

\section{Future Work}

\section{Conclusion}
