   - bad name.  Maybe should be defined in LayoutObj ?
+ Helpers         
   - bad name.  Should be under some PrettyPrint.* namespace
+ ASTCode         
  - this should be moved to Language.Drasil.AST.C
  - split Method and Args declarations
  - is fine for now, but probably will require replacement later
+ PrintC          
  - should be moved to Language.Drasil.Printers.C
  - make Show instance more clearly an 'interpretation'
  - simplify code
+ Format          
  - move Accent to Spec
  - move Decoration to Symbol
+ Unicode         
+ Symbol          
  - add 'hat' and 'vec' helpers
  - FormatS -> Atop
  - Catenate -> Concat (of a list, not just 2)
+ Spec            
  - Huge change: Spec -> Sentence.
    Spec started out as a very syntactic way to "specify" everything,
    and evolved over time.  Looking at it now, it is clear that what one
    can now write with Spec are sentences.  Actually, they are really just
    fragments (as certain things are for characters!) from single letters
    to words to phrases to sentences.  But it is premature to split things
    that finely.  But it really should be called what it is.
