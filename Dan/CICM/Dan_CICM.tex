% This is a simple template for a LaTeX document using the "article" class.
% See "book", "report", "letter" for other types of document.

\documentclass[11pt]{article} % use larger type; default would be 10pt

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % set input encoding (not needed with XeLaTeX)

%%% Examples of Article customizations
% These packages are optional, depending whether you want the features they provide.
% See the LaTeX Companion or other references for full information.

%%% PAGE DIMENSIONS
\usepackage{geometry} % to change the page dimensions
\geometry{a4paper} % or letterpaper (US) or a5paper or....
% \geometry{margin=2in} % for example, change the margins to 2 inches all round
% \geometry{landscape} % set up the page for landscape
%   read geometry.pdf for detailed page layout information

\usepackage{graphicx} % support the \includegraphics command and options

% \usepackage[parfill]{parskip} % Activate to begin paragraphs with an empty line rather than an indent

%%% PACKAGES
\usepackage{booktabs} % for much better looking tables
\usepackage{array} % for better arrays (eg matrices) in maths
\usepackage{paralist} % very flexible & customisable lists (eg. enumerate/itemize, etc.)
\usepackage{verbatim} % adds environment for commenting out blocks of text & for better verbatim
\usepackage{subfig} % make it possible to include more than one captioned figure/table in a single float
% These packages are all incorporated in the memoir class to one degree or another...

%%% HEADERS & FOOTERS
\usepackage{fancyhdr} % This should be set AFTER setting up the page geometry
\pagestyle{fancy} % options: empty , plain , fancy
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt} % customise the layout...
\lhead{}\chead{}\rhead{}
\lfoot{}\cfoot{\thepage}\rfoot{}

%%% SECTION TITLE APPEARANCE
\usepackage{sectsty}
\allsectionsfont{\sffamily\mdseries\upshape} % (See the fntguide.pdf for font help)
% (This matches ConTeXt defaults)

%%% ToC (table of contents) APPEARANCE
\usepackage[nottoc,notlof,notlot]{tocbibind} % Put the bibliography in the ToC

\section{Research Questions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How to improve reuse mathematical knowledge for scientific and engineering models
	\item How to improve NFRs like traceability, maintainability, and (re)usability
	\item How to handle the massive amount of mathematical knowledge duplication
					across multiple artifacts in a software development project
\end{itemize}

\section{Research Plans}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Create an infrastructure(/tool?) for knowledge capture and reuse %D EDIT
	\item Focus on avoiding duplication and maintaining clear traceability
	\item Utilize generative programming to create software artifacts from the
					captured knowledge.
	\item Perform a case study involving applying the tool to the realm of
					Scientific Computing (as a proof of concept).
\end{itemize}

\section{Completed and Remaining Research}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Completed part one of the comprehensive exams.
	\item Completed the majority of required coursework.
	\item Currently building a prototype.
	\item This point is the best for feedback and additional insight from others.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation Plans}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The tool will be applied to a real-world problem in the realm of safety
					analysis in nuclear power systems.
	\item Evaluation will be based on feedback from experts in the field.
	\item Quantify the effort involved in making a likely change through
					traditional methods versus with the tool.
\end{itemize}

\section{Publication Plans}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Paper for SLE / GPCE - Currently in the works
	\item Plan to target a paper towards ICSE
	\item Plan to target towards Science of Computer Programming
\end{itemize}
