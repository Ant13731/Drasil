\section{Introduction}

Context
- first application of computers was scientific computing (SC)
- the importance of SC code - used for decisions that impact health, safety and the economy
- important enough to follow certification standards in some cases, CSA, Roache
- problem with standards is the time and money required to meet them, resistance from practitioners (can cite Roache to support this)
- many scientists seem to prefer a more agile development process (cite Carver, Kelly and Segal - see Smith book chapter for specific references), but this does not mean that this is the best process - with the proper methods and tools, scientists can follow a more structured approach, and still focus on frequent feedback and course correction - can meet documentation requirements for certification, and improve productivity.

Our goal is to have our cake and eat it too.  We want to improve the qualities (verifiability, reliability, understandability etc.) especially traceability.  Moreover, we want to improve productivity. Save time and money on SC software development, certification and re-certification.  Improving traceability also allows us to improve reproducibility (cite Davison2012) because the decisions and details are explicitly available in the future.

To accomplish this we need to do the following:

- Remove duplication between software artifacts for scientific computing software (can cite Wilson et al DRY principle)
- Provide a means for complete traceability between all artifacts

To achieve the above two goals, we propose the following:

- Provide tools to support developing scientific software using a literate process
- Use artifact generation

- roadmap of the sections that are coming

\section{Background}

- introductory blurb for this section

\subsection{Challenges for Scientific Computing Software Quality}

From Yu (2011) (PhD thesis, now in our repository)
- approximation challenge [Smith advice - remove, we don’t really address this challenge with our solution]
- unknown solution challenge - no test oracle [Smith advice - remove, we don’t really address this challenge with our solution]
- technique selection challenge - [I think we can keep this challenge, if we later mention how LSS encourages a separation of concerns between requirements (model) and design (numerical algorithm selection).  LSS also allows for experimentation with different numerical techniques.]  
- input output challenge [I think we should keep this one, but we should characterize it as an understandability challenge.  Programmers do not reuse libraries as often as they could because they do not believe that the interface needs to be as complicated as it appears (Dubois2002).  We can mention this challenge again later, because LSS will allow us to create programs, and interfaces, that are only as complicated as they need to be.]
- modification challenge [I think we could relabel this as a maintainability challenge.]

\subsection{Literate Programming}

- overview of LP, starting with Knuth - a similar background to what we need here is given in SmithKoothoorAndNedialkov.pdf

\section{Introducing LSS} % (NEED A BETTER NAME)

- Tie the introduction of the paper into the tool.
- Introduce the ideas of recipes and chunks.
- Explain some of the current design?
  - i.e. Chunk hierarchy diagram, recipe micro/macro layout languages, code gen

\subsection{Advantages}

Move into examples/discussion on advantages.

\subsubsection{Software Certification}
- need to generate required documentation, without impeding the work of the scientists
- need to be able to make changes at reasonable cost - this requires traceability

- Discuss the following documents as being "par for the course" but maybe don't 
  include full descriptions:
    Start with a default set of documentation, as follows
    - Problem Statement
    - Development Plan
    - Requirements Specification
    - Verification and Validation plan
    - Design Specification
    - Code
    - Verification and Validation Report
    - User Manual

\subsubsection{Knowledge Capture}
- conservation of thermal energy equation - used for thermal analysis of fuel pins and then reused for solar water heating tank
- Build a library of artifacts that can be reused in many different contexts
- Prime example: SI Units are used everywhere.

\subsubsection{"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."  (Einstein quote)}
- although powerful/general commercial finite element programs are available, they are often not used to develop new “widgets”
- reasons are cost, and complexity
- rather than use simulation, engineers often resort to building prototypes and testing
- engineers would greatly benefit from tools to assist their design efforts that are customized to their exact set of problems - with a literate family approach family members can be generated to fit their needs
- if an engineer designs parts for strength, they could have a general stress analysis program - the program could be 3D if needed, or specialized for plane stress or plane strain, if that was the appropriate assumption - the program could even be customized to the parameterized shape of the part they are interested in, with only the degrees of freedom, like material properties, or the specific dimensions, they can change being exposed.
[This section is also where we can mention the understandability challenge from Section 2.1.  LSS lets us build components that provide exactly what is needed, and no more.]

\subsubsection{Verification}

- requirements include so-called “sanity” checks that can be reused when they come up in subsequent phases
- for instance, requirement would state conservation of mass, or the fact that lengths are always positive - the first used to test output, the second to guard against invalid input

- computational variability testing, from Yu (2011), FEM example
- usual to do grid refinement tests - same order of interpolation, but more points
- code generation allows for increases in the order of interpolation, for the same grid
- Yu discusses in section 6.3 of her thesis

\subsubsection{Testing} % Maybe move this to future work?

- ???

\subsection{Bringing it together with an example}

- Introduce fuel pin example.
- Use appendix for SRS and generated SRS?

\subsubsection{How it works}
- Explain the source (recipe, common knowledge, specific knowledge)
- Show example recipe
- Example of common knowledge (SI Units to tie into section 3.1.2)
- Example of specific knowledge ($h_c$ or $h_g$ chunk)

\subsubsection{The result?}

- Bring it all back to the arguments made in 3.1.1-3.1.4 and justify them.

- 3.1.1: (Ideally) No cost to make changes, no longer impedes the scientists.
    - Explain in-depth

- 3.1.2: SI Units shows that common knowledge is easily stored to be used elsewhere
    - No need to reinvent the wheel! Keeps things consistent across projects.
    
- 3.1.3: (Ideally) Prototyping becomes trivial due to code gen.
    - Any changes to spec can be seen in (essentially) real-time.
    
- 3.1.4: Any mistakes that occur in the software artifacts occur everywhere.
    - Easier to find errors since they propagate through all the artifacts.
    - Documents are never out of sync with the source.

\section{Future work}

- Generate more document types (more default recipes)
- Include more types of information in chunks (PCM SRS example of constraints, etc.)
  - Auto-generate test cases! Use constraint/typical value info to create tests.
  - Use constraints for errors and typical values for warnings.
- Expand the tool practically through examples.
    
\section{Concluding Remarks}

%\section{The {\secit Body} of The Paper}

%\subsection{Type Changes and {\subsecit Special} Characters}
%We have already seen several typeface changes in this sample.  You
%can indicate italicized words or phrases in your text with
%the command \texttt{{\char'134}textit}; emboldening with the
%command \texttt{{\char'134}textbf}
%and typewriter-style (for instance, for computer code) with
%\texttt{{\char'134}texttt}.  But remember, you do not
%have to indicate typestyle changes when such changes are
%part of the \textit{structural} elements of your
%article; for instance, the heading of this subsection will
%be in a sans serif\footnote{A third footnote, here.
%Let's make this a rather short one to
%see how it looks.} typeface, but that is handled by the
%document class file. Take care with the use
%of\footnote{A fourth, and last, footnote.}
%the curly braces in typeface changes; they mark
%the beginning and end of
%the text that is to be in the different typeface.
%
%You can use whatever symbols, accented characters, or
%non-English characters you need anywhere in your document;
%you can find a complete list of what is
%available in the \textit{\LaTeX\
%User's Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

%\subsection{Math Equations}

%\subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
%A formula that appears in the running text is called an
%inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
%\textbf{math} environment, which can be
%invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin. . .{\char'134}end}
%construction or with the short form \texttt{\$. . .\$}. You
%can use any of the symbols and structures,
%from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
%\LaTeX\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
%few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
%this equation: \begin{math}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{math},
%set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
%set in display style.  (See next section).

%\subsubsection{Display Equations}
%A numbered display equation -- one set off by vertical space
%from the text and centered horizontally -- is produced
%by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered display
%equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.
%
%Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
%and structures available in \LaTeX; this section will just
%give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
%First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:
%\begin{equation}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{equation}
%Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
%the \textbf{displaymath}
%environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
%\begin{displaymath}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1\end{displaymath}
%and follow it with another numbered equation:
%\begin{equation}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f\end{equation}
%just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

%\subsection{Citations}
%Citations to articles \cite{bowman:reasoning,
%clark:pct, braams:babel, herlihy:methodology},
%conference proceedings \cite{clark:pct} or
%books \cite{salas:calculus, Lamport:LaTeX} listed
%in the Bibliography section of your
%article will occur throughout the text of your article.
%You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
%you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
%a key of the item cited in the proper location in
%the \texttt{.tex} file \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
%The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
%identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
%the first author's surname and a
%word from the title.  This identifying key is included
%with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.
%
%The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
%are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
%information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
%and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
%Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
%
%This article shows only the plainest form
%of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
%This is what is stipulated in the SIGS style specifications.
%No other citation format is endorsed or supported.
%
%\subsection{Tables}
%Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
%placement for them is typically the top of the page
%nearest their initial cite.  To
%ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
%environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
%the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
%in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
%be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
%horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
%on \textbf{tabular} material
%is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.
%
%Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
%Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
%placement of the table here with the table in the printed
%dvi output of this document.
%
%\begin{table}
%\centering
%\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
%\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
%Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
%\O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
%$\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
%\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
%$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
%\hline\end{tabular}
%\end{table}
%
%To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
%the page's live area, use the environment
%\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
%the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
%table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
%Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
%Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
%instructive to compare the placement of the
%table here with the table in the printed dvi
%output of this document.
%
%
%\begin{table*}
%\centering
%\caption{Some Typical Commands}
%\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
%Command&A Number&Comments\\ \hline
%\texttt{{\char'134}alignauthor} & 100& Author alignment\\ \hline
%\texttt{{\char'134}numberofauthors}& 200& Author enumeration\\ \hline
%\texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
%\texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
%\end{table*}
%% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!
%
%\subsection{Figures}
%Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
%best placement for them
%is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
%their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
%of figures, use the environment
%\textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.
%
%This sample document contains examples of \textbf{.eps} files to be
%displayable with \LaTeX.  If you work with pdf\LaTeX, use files in the
%\textbf{.pdf} format.  Note that most modern \TeX\ system will convert
%\textbf{.eps} to \textbf{.pdf} for you on the fly.  More details on
%each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

%\centering
%%\includegraphics[height=1in, width=1in]{fly}
%\caption{A sample black and white graphic
%that has been resized with the \texttt{includegraphics} command.}
%\end{figure}
%
%
%As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
%that spans two columns.  To do this, and still to
%ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
%\textbf{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.
%and don't forget to end the environment with
%{figure*}, not {figure}!
%

%\vskip -6pt
%\end{figure}
%
%\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
%Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
%the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
%corollaries and proofs.  There are
%two forms, one produced by the
%command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
%other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
%the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
%to compare the two in the output of this sample document:
%
%This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
%the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
%\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
%\begin{theorem}
%Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
%an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
%\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
%\end{theorem}
%
%The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
%by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:
%\newdef{definition}{Definition}
%\begin{definition}
%If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
%unique number which has
%logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
%\end{definition}
%
%Two lists of constructs that use one of these
%forms is given in the
%\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.
% 
%There is one other similar construct environment, which is
%already set up
%for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
%a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
%create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
%is a example of its use:
%\begin{proof}
%Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
%\begin{displaymath}
%\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
%\end{displaymath}
%Then
%\begin{displaymath}
%l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
%= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
%\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
%= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
%\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
%\end{displaymath}
%which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
%\end{proof}
%
%Complete rules about using these environments and using the
%two different creation commands are in the
%\textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
%detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
%not listed therein, which you want to have the same
%formatting as the Theorem
%or the Definition\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
%use the \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the
%\texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
%respectively, to create it.
%
%\subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
%Because you have just been given permission to
%use the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to create a
%new form, you might think you can
%use \TeX's \texttt{{\char'134}def} to create a
%new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
%Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
%to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
%to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
%some or all of the \texttt{{\char'134}def}s recompilation will
%be, to say the least, problematic.
%
%\section{Conclusions}
%This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
%Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
%Appendices; brief samples of these
%follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
%we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
%of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
%this paper are to articles which have nothing to
%do with the present subject and are used as
%examples only.
%%\end{document}  % This is where a 'short' article might terminate
%
%%ACKNOWLEDGMENTS are optional
%\section{Acknowledgments}
%This section is optional; it is a location for you
%to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and

%\section{Headings in Appendices}
%The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for

%In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
%\textbf{section} is used to
