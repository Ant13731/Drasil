\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Literate Scientific Software}

\begin{itemize}
\item Motivation
\begin{itemize}
\item Improve verifiability, maintainability and reusability.
\item Save money and time% when managing change.
\end{itemize}
\item One ``source,'' multiple views
\begin{itemize}
\item Requirements%, including or excluding derivations.
\item Design
\item Test Cases
\item Build instructions
\item ...

%\frametitle{Literate Software Development for Scientific Software}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Advantages
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Avoid duplication through chunk reuse.
%\item Improve understandability, traceability and reproducibility.
%\item Increased flexibility
%\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Recap}

Last time:
\begin{itemize}
\item Took a look at a simple example from a project involving a fuel pin.
\item Discussed the challenges of managing change throughout the software documentation.
\item Proposed encapsulating all of the requisite knowledge in one source composed of ``chunks''.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Example: $h_g$ and $h_c$}

\framesubtitle{A simple example taken from the SRS for FP}

Let's take a quick look at the hand-written Software Requirements 
Specification (SRS) for $h_g$ and $h_c$
	and compare it to the one generated by the LSS framework.

%D Bring up the pdfs and compare -> First page is almost identical (with
%	minor additions to the table of units). Second page missing -> explain

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Example: $h_g$ and $h_c$}

\framesubtitle{The source}

The current source for this example is broken up into three pieces.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The recipe %Body
	\item Global/often reused chunks %SI_Units
	\item New chunks specific to this example %Example

\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%D Maybe don't bother with slides for Recipe/Chunks/Global Chunks?

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Example: $h_g$ and $h_c$}

\framesubtitle{The Recipe}

The recipe is how we specify exactly what we want our view to look like.
\newline \newline
It tells the generator what information is needed and how that information
should be displayed.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Example: $h_g$ and $h_c$}
\framesubtitle{Global Chunks}

Global chunks are chunks that will often be reused across many different projects.
As such they are grouped with relevant related information and kept in 
specific source files.
\newline \newline
This example contains one set of global chunks: SI Units.

%D Pull up SI Units to show a quick chunk example?

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Example: $h_g$ and $h_c$}

\framesubtitle{New Chunks}

This example contains two obvious chunks that need to be declared:
$h_g$ and $h_c$.
\newline \newline
There are also a few less obvious chunks that need to be declared:
the values which $h_g$ and $h_c$ depend on in their equations. 
For example $\tau_c$, $k_c$, etc.

%D Pull up Example1.hs for a quick look?

\end{frame}

\section[The Design]{The Current Framework Design}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Framework Design}

\framesubtitle{Chunks}

Chunks come in many flavours:
The simplest type has only one field (name). Each more complex chunk builds off
this base and adds (at least) one new field. 
\newline \newline
All of the more complex chunks are built up from simpler chunks. 
\newline \newline
Currently there are a few different types of chunks including (but not limited
to) those for describing concepts and variables.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Framework Design}

\framesubtitle{Recipes}

Recipes are specified using a domain-specific language.
\newline \newline
They tell the generator both what information needs to be laid out
and how that information should be laid out for the current document type.
\newline \newline
There will exist many types of Recipes, however currently only the SRS recipe
is working.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Framework Design}

\framesubtitle{The Generator}

The generator is fairly straightforward. It:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Takes a given recipe and looks up all the requisite information.
	\item Creates an internal generalized representation of the document being 
			generated.
	\item Translates that internal representation to one specific to the
			format of the desired output.
	\item Prints the document to the desired output format.
\end{itemize}

Currently the generator only prints to a TeX representation (the same as the
example SRS source), which can then be typeset.

\begin{Large}
What next?
\end{Large}

\begin{itemize}
\item Generate the rest of example 1.
\item Finish implementing options for different document "views".
\begin{itemize}
\item Ex. SRS with or without derivations.
\end{itemize}
\item Implement additional document types.
\item Generate the source code from the equations.
\item Implement more examples using the framework.
\end{itemize}
