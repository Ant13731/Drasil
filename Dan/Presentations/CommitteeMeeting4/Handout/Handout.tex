\section{Too much duplication!}

In any given piece of software, the same knowledge will appear across a number 
of different artifacts. Manually entering this knowledge in multiple places 
introduces the potential for errors to occur.

From our case study on a fuel pin in a nuclear reactor, we see $h_g$~--~a 
symbol which appears in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), the 
Literate Programmer's Manual (LPM), and the source code.

The following table shows a (simplified) definition of $h_g$ taken from the 
SRS. Its defining equation also appears in Equation~\ref{E:h.g}, which was 
taken from the LPM.

\noindent
\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
\begin{tabular}{p{\colAwidth} p{\colBwidth}}
\toprule
\textbf{Number} & \textbf{DD\refstepcounter{datadefnum}\thedatadefnum} 
\label{hg}\\
\midrule
Label & $h_g$\\
\midrule
Equation & $h_g$ =$ \frac{2k_{c}h_{p}}{2k_{c}+\tau_c h_{p}}$\\
\midrule
Description & $h_g$ is the  gap conductance \dots \\
\midrule
\dots \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}\\

\begin{equation}
\label{E:h.g} 
h_{g} =\frac{2k_{c}h_{p}}{2k_{c}+\tau_c h_{p}}
\end{equation}

We then see the same equation appear in the 
corresponding C code for $h_g$ given by:

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\scriptsize]
double calc_hg(double k_c,double h_b,double tau_c)
{
 return (2*(k_c)*(h_p)) / ((2*(k_c)) + (tau_c*(h_p)));
}
\end{lstlisting}

This situation comes up all the time and writing the same information in 
multiple places is tedious. Wouldn't it  
make more sense to encode a definition once and 
automatically reuse it wherever necessary in our artifacts?
