\framesubtitle{Key Problem(s)}


%D Slide looks too cluttered with all this information, going to remove the 
% enumerated items and only leave the questions. Will say the numbered parts
% aloud.

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Many scientific and engineering models %in the abstract sense
%	tend to reuse the same underlying mathematical knowledge, yet are
%	reimplemented for new software projects.
How can we
	\begin{itemize}
	\item improve the reuse of mathematical knowledge?
%	\end{itemize}

%\item Across software artifacts there is typically a non-trivial amount of 
%	knowledge duplication.

%	\begin{itemize}
	\item handle knowledge duplication across software artifacts?
%	\end{itemize}

%\item It is often the case (cite: Kelly) that non-functional requirements (NFRs)
%	are
%	considered nice to have, but not as critical as correctness, accuracy, and
%	performance.
	
%	\begin{itemize}
	\item improve the qualities of
					traceability, maintainability, verifiability and (re)usability?
	\end{itemize}

%\end{enumerate}

%D Yup, way too much text. Commented out as per above note.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%D Insert slides addressing the problems: 
%		How can we improve reuse? - Open question, lots of possible answers, but
%			which is the ``best'' one? No idea. It's time to take a practical approach.
%			Trying not to ``overdesign'' and underimplement.
%   Why is duplication not solved yet? - Knowledge is being shared across 
%			languages/artifacts/views.
%		Are these specific to math software? - No. However, math \& scientific
%			software domains tend to be well-understood, making it much easier to
%			address the problems in this domain first.

%D Where should I bring in some lit review? I'd like to mention MMT at some point.
%		Formal content of the knowledge is not (yet) the focus. Reusing the knowledge
%		via recipes is the true focus.

%D Intentional Programming to come up somewhere?

How can we improve the reuse of mathematical knowledge? 
%D -Open question, lots of possible answers, but
%			which is the ``best'' one? No idea. It's time to take a practical approach.
%			Trying not to ``overdesign'' and underimplement. With that in mind...
%\begin{enumerate} enum or itemize?
\begin{itemize}
\item Simplify the knowledge store
%D Not sure if I should include these as bullets or just talking points
\item Create a means of obtaining knowledge relevant to a project
%	\begin{itemize}
%	\item Use a single source for the creation of artifacts
%	\item Make it language/view independent
%	\item Make it sexy
%	\end{itemize}
\item Make it accessible %So anyone can use it.
\end{itemize}
%\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Research}
\framesubtitle{Musings Cont'd}

Why is the duplication problem not solved yet? 
%D Especially since many languages have useful abstraction features and tools 
%		for reducing the amount of code duplication? Short answer: These features 
%		only go so far.

\begin{itemize}
\item Existing tools and abstraction features only go so far
%D They might be very useful for source code, and even sometimes extend to some
%   of the documentation (through tools like doxygen, literate programming
%   practices, etc.). These tools and practices don't help as much when dealing
%   with multiple languages or types of artifacts.
\item Knowledge is shared across languages/artifacts/views
%D Example?

\item No standard method for encoding knowledge or reusing it
%D How do you write something in a way that is both human and computer readable
%	  in a simple enough manner that clients can read it? They may be experts in 
%	  the domain of interest, but not necessarily in the computer-readable 
%   language.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Research}
\framesubtitle{Solution Plan}

Create an infrastructure / tool for knowledge capture and reuse.

\begin{itemize}
\item Focus: avoid knowledge duplication across artifacts through reuse%D copy/pasting
\item Maintain: clear traceability between artifacts
\item Utilize: generative programming to create artifacts from captured
	knowledge
\item Expand: ideas from literate programming

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%D This slide and the next are more of an ``overview'' of the plan of attack.
%		 More in-depth info is to follow.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Research}
\framesubtitle{Solution Plan Cont'd}

Create an infrastructure / tool for knowledge capture and reuse.

\begin{itemize}
\item Create: a domain-specific language for both knowledge capture \& the 
	artifact	generator
\item Implement: a feature for creating program families. %Allows us to
				%easily design for change.
%D Example time -> determinant calculation involving a known matrix with 
%		many zeroes vs. unknown input matrices.
\item Test: apply the tool to real world problems in scientific computing.

%D Thus concludes the gist of the plan. Now talk a bit more in-depth on
%		the questions.

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Prototype}
\framesubtitle{Design and Development}
%D Practical approach -> Don't overdesign and underdevelop
%   Build off examples. Flesh out the details as we go.

\begin{itemize}
\item Taking a practical approach
%D Many reasons for this. Avoids overdesigning the solution since this is a
%   fairly ambitious project which could stay in design for a decade without
%   making much progress. Also, since we're working with industry examples we
%   have a solid starting point and clear goals for the output.
\item Focusing on knowledge reuse as opposed to the formal capture of the
				knowledge itself.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%D Maybe bring up the stuff below once getting to the prototype goals?

$h_g$ is a symbol which appears in several locations including:

\item The Literate Programmer's Manual
\item The Source Code
\end{itemize}

Let's take a look!

\frametitle{Example: $h_g$}

\framesubtitle{A simple example taken from the SRS for FP}

Modifying $h_g$ to reflect changes in requirements is not a simple
matter. It involves, at the very least, the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Update the definition in the SRS, LPM, and all other documents which
  reference the symbol
\item Modify the source code to reflect the new requirements
\item Trace all dependencies
\item Modify dependents to accomodate the change
\item Ensure each of the documents is now up to date and consistent
\end{itemize}
