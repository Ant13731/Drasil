%% Outline

%% introduce the problem Drasil is solving (developing SCS, consistency, certification, etc)
%% Introduce Drasil 
%% What is my problem with Drasil as it stand? (It needs some cleaning)
%% How does Drasil work?
%% What are chunks?
%% What is a minimal example?

%% What are ReqChunk, AssumpChunk, Changes? (Noticed from the minimal/toy example)
%% Hey, they're in the wrong place.
%% Let's take a look at them to better understand them (and how they transform to being printed)
%% Hey they're the same.
%% We were going to put them in docLang, but they're the same, what if we refactor and put the essence in lang?
%% If we merge them as is we lose semantic meaning
%% What if we add a domain?
	%% How do we structure domains as a tree
	%% Why because then we can select categories of a certain "size" (ex. All requirement or just functional)
%% Okay, let's do that.
%% Welp, references
	%% RefProg detour
	%% A language for references
	%% Defer when we assemble references.
	%% Tag the domain since we derive from that
%% Okay, we done. But assumptions in DocDesc was a pain, let's fix that.


%%% How does assumptions currently work
%% Why is it better (declarative)
%% Let's look at what DocLang touches
%% Yikes, the passes, that is a lot of redundant code
%% Yikes, that traceability matrix
%% Views!
%% Multiplate!!!
%% Yikes, examples do redundant parsing of DocDesc, let's lift to the Doc-time level.
%% Okay, they're cleaner, let's add a pass to be more declarative
%% Dope

%% Build system needs love, tedious to manually compile latex
%% Ugh, the makefile could use some refactoring
% Compile latex
%% Building code since it's similar to TeX.
%% It's inconvenient to require 4+ compilers, to test locally. 
	%% What if we revamp our CI to do a comprehensive testing of artefacts.
%% Warnings always appear, let's enforce that on CI to ensure no more PR's of "fixing warnings"
%% Let's standardize code because that the natural extension to warnings
	%% HLint
%% We have the CI artefacts, but end of build we throw them away. This feels wasteful.
%% We should have a public page for Drasil with our generated artefacts so new people don't have to compile from scratch!
	%% We use a static site generator
	%% HAkyll
%% How we tie the artefacts with the makefile knowledge to have a deploy into CI.
	%% Hey look! All of this is connected!
%% But alas I'm done
%% HEre's some future work

% Recap what I've done
% Reiterste how all of these improve Drasil architecturally and fit the philosophy.
