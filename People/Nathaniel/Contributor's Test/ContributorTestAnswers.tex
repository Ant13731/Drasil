\question{2 marks}
When creating a new issue on GitHub, describe two tips to follow that help to ensure that the new issue includes enough information (context).

\answer{Answer here.}{0cm}{0cm}

Sample Answers (any two of the following work):
\begin{itemize}
    \item include (annotated) excerpts of PDF/HTML documentation when referring to output (desired or generated); highlighting specific portions of such relevant screenshots helps important info stand out to the reader
    \item linking related issues, pull requests, comments and commit hashes; provides easy navigation through related content and discussion significant to the issue
    \item creating permalinks (permanent links) to code sections/snippets relevant to the issue
    \item directly inserting code into Issue comments (using markdown format); useful for recommending/proposing solutions of multi-line code (mentioning the language allows for syntax highlighting, which is helpful)
\end{itemize}

\question{2 marks}
Explain the concept of cherry-picking in GitHub. Be sure to include what command(s) and information you would use to accomplish it.

\answer{Answer here.}{0cm}{7cm}

Sample Answer
\begin{itemize}
    \item cherry-picking in GitHub is the concept/process of moving a specific commit from one branch onto another (new branch)
    \item there are two commands you would likely need to use:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \lstinline{git checkout} to ensure that you are on the branch you want to commit to
        \item \lstinline{git cherry-pick <commit-hash>} to move a specific commit (referenced by commit-hash) to the new branch
    \end{itemize}
    \item the information you would need to accomplish cherry-picking is the \lstinline{commit-hash} of the specific commit you would like to move to the new branch
\end{itemize}

Describe Drasil (what is it, what does it do), and discuss its main goals.

\answer{Answer here.}{0cm}{7cm}

Sample Answer
\begin{itemize}
    \item Drasil is a framework for generating \textbf{all} software artifacts (e.g. code, documentation) from a stable knowledge base
    \item the main goals of Drasil are to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item reduce knowledge duplication; concepts, ideas and algorithms should only have to be defined once (and be reused easily)
        \item improve traceability; more easily display how various components of the program are linked/dependent upon each other
        \item improve maintainability, verifiability, traceability and other software qualities (more as a side-effect of methods used rather than as a main goal)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\question{2 marks}
Imagine that you have made changes to some files in the Drasil code on your local repository. Describe the process that you would take to update the remote repository for Drasil with your changes. List any commands that you would use here as well.

\answer{Answer here.}{0cm}{7cm}

Sample Answer
\begin{itemize}
    \item \lstinline{git add <relative path to file>}: stage a file to a commit; be sure to repeat this multiple times for multiple changed files, or use \lstinline{git add *} cautiously (command stages all changed files)
    \item \lstinline{git commit -m "commit message"}: commit your staged changes to your local repository; be sure to include a descriptive commit message
    \item \lstinline{git push}: push changes from your local repository to the remote repository (thus updating it)
\end{itemize}
